//NOTE: Was planned to used a MUI Modal but having a Modal inside a Modal caused JS stack issues.

import React from 'react';

type PopupFourProps = {
  position: {
    top: number;
    left: number;
    width: number;
  };
}

export function PopupFour({ position }: PopupFourProps) {
  const newButtonStyle = {

  return (
